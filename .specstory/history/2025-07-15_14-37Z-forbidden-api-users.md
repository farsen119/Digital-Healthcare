_**Assistant**_

The error message:

```
Forbidden: /api/users/
[15/Jul/2025 20:09:53] "GET /api/users/?role=doctor HTTP/1.1" 403 58
```

means that your request to `/api/users/?role=doctor` is being denied with a **403 Forbidden** HTTP status code. This usually happens due to one of the following reasons:

### Common Causes

1. **Authentication Required**: The endpoint requires the user to be logged in, but the request is unauthenticated.
2. **Permission Denied**: The authenticated user does not have the required permissions to access this endpoint.
3. **CSRF Protection**: For POST/PUT/DELETE requests, missing or invalid CSRF tokens can cause 403 errors (mainly in Django).
4. **API Key/Token Missing or Invalid**: If your API uses token-based authentication, the token might be missing or invalid.

## How to Debug

### 1. **Check Authentication**
- Are you logged in when making this request?
- If using a frontend, is the authentication token/cookie being sent with the request?
- If using an API tool (like Postman), are you including the correct headers (e.g., `Authorization: Token ...`)?

### 2. **Check Permissions**
- Does the user have permission to view users with the role "doctor"?
- Check your Django (or other backend) permissions for this endpoint.

### 3. **Check CSRF Token (if applicable)**
- For unsafe methods (POST, PUT, DELETE), ensure the CSRF token is included.
- For GET requests, this is usually not the issue, but some custom setups may require it.

### 4. **Backend Logs**
- Check your backend code for the `/api/users/` endpoint.
- Look for permission classes, authentication classes, or custom logic that could return 403.

## Next Steps

To help you further, I need more information:
- What backend framework are you using (Django, Flask, etc.)?
- Are you making this request from a frontend, API client, or directly in the browser?
- Are you authenticated? If so, what kind of authentication (session
